# Hope C-Tech

Hope C-Tech is a game engine which is going to be used for experimentation, prototyping and eventually games.

Note: This is at an early development stage. 

## Getting Started

A Visual Studio 2019 solution is included. 

Although we use cross-platform libraries, we mostly focus on development for windows platform.

### Running

To run the application, include the appropriate runtime dlls in your executable folder.
Runtime dlls are located inside the runtime_DLL folder.

### Distribution

To distribute the application except for the appropriate runtime dlls, also include 
a folder (/assets/shaders) with the shader files.

## Languages and Libraries
* C++
* SDL2
* OpenGL
* GLEW
